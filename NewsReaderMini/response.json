He was released after posting a $10,000 bond.</p>\n                        <p>Austin (Texas) police spokesman Brandon Jones said Beard is accused of choking a person at a home in the Tarrytown neighborhood in West Austin. Officers responded to a 911 \"disturbance-urgent\" call at 2:07 a.m. CT Monday.</p>\n                        <p>Beard was booked into jail at 4:18 a.m. CT, according to the Travis County sheriff's office jail records. He faces a third-degree felony charge of assault on a family/household member impeding breath circulation.</p>\n                        <p>Texas released a brief statement on the arrest in the morning, saying, \"The university is aware of the situation regarding Chris Beard.

He should never have been arrested. The complainant wants him released immediately and all charges dismissed.  It is truly inconceivable.”</p>\n                        <p>Beard, 49, is in his second year at Texas. Before replacing Shaka Smart in 2021, he spent five seasons at Texas Tech and led the Red Raiders to the 2019 NCAA championship game. Beard, who has also coached at Fort Scott Community College, Seminole State College, McMurry University, Angelo State and Arkansas-Little Rock, is a 1995 Texas graduate.</p>\n                        <p>When he was hired at Texas in 2021, Beard received a seven-year contract with an annual salary of $5 million.</p>\n                        <p>A clause in the contract allows the university to terminate or suspend Beard with cause for \"Any conduct (a) that the University administration reasonably determines is clearly unbecoming to a Head Coach and reflects poorly on the University, the Program, or The University of Texas System; or (b) resulting in a criminal charge being brought against Head Coach involving a felony, or any crime involving theft, dishonesty, or moral turpitude.\"</p>\n                        <p>It is a standard clause in Texas coaching contracts.</p>\n                        <p>Beard's No. 8-ranked Longhorns (7-1) were scheduled to play Rice on Monday night at Moody Center. Texas last played on Saturday, beating Arkansas-Pine Bluff 88-43. Texas had not announced who would coach the team against the Owls as of Monday afternoon.</p>\n                        <p>Associate head coach Rodney Terry has been a head coach at UTEP (2018-21) and Fresno State (2011-18). He first coached at Texas from 2002 to 2011 on former head coach Rick Barnes' staff. Beard's staff also has assistant coaches Brandon Chappell and Bob Donewald Jr. And Chris Ogden, who serves as the team's managing director, was the head coach at Texas-Arlington from 2018 to 2021.</p>\n                        <p><em>This article originally appeared on Austin American-Statesman: <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/big12/2022/12/12/chris-beard-texas-basketball-coach-charged-domestic-assault/10881830002/\">Chris Beard, Texas basketball coach, charged with domestic assault</a></em></p>",

That’s how many consecutive Catholic League swimming championships <strong>La Salle </strong>has claimed. And there’s no indication that the Explorers, who finished second in the PIAA Class 3A championships, are ready to end that incredible streak. Four of the team’s returners, <strong>Noah Lubinski, Aidan Schnapf, Gabe Cowart </strong>and <strong>Alex Sleptsov</strong> were individual point scorers in the PIAA state championships and will be aiming for gold medals this time around. </p>\n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\"><strong>Wood looks to make a move in the girls PCL standings...</strong></h2>\n<p>On the girls' side, no team has a stranglehold in the PCL, and <strong>Archbishop Wood</strong> won the championship in the 2017-2018 season. Last year, despite having just eight swimmers, the Vikings finished with a winning record and sent several swimmers to the state championships. This season, the Vikings look to increase their numbers and continue the success their returning swimmers saw last season. Seniors <strong>Elizabeth Hetzel </strong>and <strong>Teresa Johnston, </strong>junior <strong>Alyssa Bean, </strong>and sophomore <strong>Alicia Yerkes </strong>make for a very solid core. </p>\n<h2 class=\"presto-h2\"><strong>Hatboro-Horsham girls look to repeat incredible season</strong></h2>\n<p><img alt=\"Kathy Jia from Hatboro Horsham leads her race in the 100 breastroke.

But this season, <strong>La Salle</strong> will host <strong>Christian Brothers Academy,</strong> ranked No. 2 in New Jersey by NJ Advance Media, on Jan. 24.

On Jan. 3, <strong>Neshaminy </strong>hosts rival <strong>Pennsbury </strong>in another Patriot division meet. Pennsbury has a small but strong senior core looking to lead the Falcons to a championship. </p>\n<p><strong>Pennsbury </strong>girls raced to their second straight SOL Patriot Division championship last season, topping <strong>Council Rock North</strong> 532-480. The two teams will face off on Jan. 17 at CR North. The meet comes just four days after <strong>Pennsbury’s </strong>matchup against archrival <strong>Neshaminy</strong>.

But a local teacher is working to change that and get these stars the recognition they deserve.</p><p>Over the last few years, Insight Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School teacher Vince Ciaramella has spent hours in cemeteries around Allegheny County, looking for the unseen.</p><p>“Sadly, their names have been forgotten and if their family doesn’t come here and pop a stone on here, they’re lost to history,” said Ciaramella.</p><p>That’s why he is documenting where local Negro League players are buried and is now trying to get them all headstones.</p><p>“I wanted to drill down a little deeper and find the guys that didn’t get the recognition and accolades that they deserved,” Ciaramella said.</p><p>Like Charles “Lefty” Williams.</p><p>He pitched for the Homestead Grays for practically his entire career from 1921 to 1935. But walking through Homestead Cemetery, you wouldn’t know it, because he doesn’t have a grave marker.</p><p>“Most of the times, economics circumstances with the families, maybe not being able to afford a marker at the time, which is the case with some of these Negro League players,” said JaQuay Carter, Historian and board member of Homestead Cemetery.</p><p>Carter would like to see players like Williams have the same recognition as other Homestead Grays.</p><p>Another player buried there is Cumberland Posey, Jr. who went by Cum Posey — Baseball Hall of Famer and eventual owner of the team.</p><p>“They really faced a lot of adversity, they had to form their own separate league, not being admitted into the major leagues,” Carter said. “So it is really nice in this day and age to honor them, decades later, but they really paved the way for so much.”</p><p>Our reporter asked: “How do you know that they’re buried there, if it’s unmarked?” It starts with doing some research on gravesite websites.</p><p>“You cross reference. I found his death certificate. So, I was able to see he was buried at homestead cemetery,” said Ciaramella. “And that’s where the boots on the ground part of it comes in you come here, start walking around trying to find where section 3 is.”</p><p>Vince has gotten a lot of help from people at cemeteries, like J. Carter, and by his count, he’s found between 30 and 40 unmarked Negro League players’ graves at several cemeteries in Allegheny County. Now, he’s working with the Josh Gibson Foundation and the Negro Leagues Baseball Grave Marker Project to mark them all.</p><p>“They had been marginalized in life and sadly they were forgotten in death and so for me, this is a great opportunity to bring their story to the limelight,” Ciaramella said.</p><p>They’re just in the fundraising phase right now, and it will be up to the owner of the plot — whether that be family or the cemetery — to decide to place a headstone.</p><p>If you would like to donate to the Negro League Grave Markers, <a href=\"https://nlbgmp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">click here.</a></p><p><i><b>Download the </b></i><a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/mobile-apps/\"><i><b>FREE WPXI News app</b></i></a><i><b> for breaking news alerts.</b></i></p><p><b>Follow Channel 11 News on </b><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wpxi\"><b>Facebook</b></a><b> and </b><a href=\"https://twitter.com/WPXI\"><b>Twitter</b></a><b>. | </b><a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/video/\"><b>Watch WPXI NOW</b></a></p><p></p><hr><p><strong>TRENDING NOW:</strong></p>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/one-person-shot-washington-county-restaurant/E4EEUEYF6BG3NHHWQP6V737YOY/\" target=\"_blank\">Police: Stepfather shot by 16-year-old near Washington County business</a> \n\t<a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/crews-responding-5-alarm-fire-downtown-pittsburgh-apartment-building/UTRG2ZDVMJDYZFNZ36QISWGLNQ/\" target=\"_blank\">1 killed, 3 treated for injuries in downtown Pittsburgh high rise fire</a> \n\t<a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/news/trending/recall-alert-jeep-recalls-nearly-63k-wranglers/466KOL27UNHBJORP45KUZCIRXY/\" target=\"_blank\">Recall alert: Jeep recalls nearly 63K Wranglers</a> \n\t<a href=\"https://www.wpxi.com/video/mother-local-victim-killed-lockerbie-bombing-speaks-out-after-arrest-made-over-30-years-later/8b4dc6b8-b533-486e-8226-a671ad7e52c2/\">VIDEO: Mother of local victim killed in Lockerbie bombing speaks out after arrest made over 30 years later</a> \n\t<a href=\"https://wpxinewsapp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">DOWNLOAD the Channel 11 News app for breaking news alerts</a> \n<hr><p></p><div id=\"civsci-id-1191105126\"></div>",
